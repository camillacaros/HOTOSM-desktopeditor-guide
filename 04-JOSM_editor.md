## Welcome!

This set of instructions will help you get set up to be part of the **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap** effort.  Please read all of the information below to get started, and don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions you may have!

### What’s this all about?

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT) is made up of volunteers from all over the globe who are helping to map previously unmapped areas.  Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a volunteer.  All you need is an OpenStreetMap account (free!) and little bit of time to give.  If you do not have an OpenStreetMap account, please follow the instructions below and sign up.  If you already have an account please read the rest of this introduction and then skip to step two.

If you are new to digitizing (tracing landscape features with satellite imagery), please refer to the [OSM Using Imagery Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_Imagery) page for an introduction to mapping with imagery.  This will give you an introduction to what you will be doing, and will caution you about a few things. Some items of note:

#### Local knowledge vs. urgent need
You are about to start contributing to a huge volunteer effort that is, in many cases, time sensitive.  While local knowledge about the areas you will be mapping would improve accuracy, your efforts to help locate what appear to be buildings, roads, and other infrastructure are useful contributions to these areas that are previously unmapped.

#### Validation
All of the work you are doing will go to the Validation stage, where an experienced GIS analyst or OSM user will double check your work and give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.  If a thumbs down is given, the Task simply gets filtered back to the Task management system for further edits.



#### Sign up for OpenStreetMap

**1. Sign up for OpenStreetMap**

Go to:  [www.openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)

Direct your attention to the top right hand corner.  Click sign up.

Fill in the fields required for sign up:
email address 
display name (read: desired username)
password

Click 

Once you are signed up, feel free to close the page.

#### JOSM
This is a guide to getting set up with the JOSM desktop editor.  This will not require you to install anything on your hard drive, as the JOSM editor is a portable application.  JOSM is the decided method for this workshop because I have found it to be the most reliable editing interface.  If you are interested in using the web editor, Walking Papers, or Potlatch please feel free to refer to the documentation on the OSM website!

2. Open the JOSM Web Editor

Go to: [josm.openstreetmap.de](josm.openstreetmap.de)

In the first large green box you see, click the josm.jnlp link.


This will begin a download of the JOSM Extensible Editor, meaning it will not install as an application on your hard drive.  You will, however, need to have Java installed in order for the editor to run properly.  The JOSM program should prompt you to install Java, or you may go to this link to download and install on your own. https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp 

If you are prompted to Keep or Discard the item, choose Keep.

Go to your Downloads folder and double click the JOSM file.


This will launch a desktop editor that is run and managed through the web.  It will not install anything on your computer, but you do need to give it permission to run.

A dialog box will appear asking “Do you want to run this application?”

Click the radio button to agree “I accept the risk and want to run this application”.  Click Run.


This will open the JOSM Editor.

If you are using Windows, click on the Edit menu in JOSM.  If you are using MacOSX, click on the JOSM menu in the top left of your screen.  Both will have a dropdown option for your Preferences.  Click on it.

On the left side of the dialog box there is a stack of icons.  Click on the remote control.  It is the third from the bottom. 

When the tab opens, click the radio button to place a check next to .

Enabling the Remote Control will allow the online Task Manager to download a task for you, as well as upload your edits when you are finished.

At the bottom of the page, click ok.  Dialog box will close.

Leave JOSM open and running.  Go back to your web browser.


3. Log in to the Humanitarian Openstreetmap Team’s Task Manager

This next section walks you through contributing to a single project, however, the skills you learn here will be transferrable to many of the HOT/HOSM projects listed on the task manager page.  

Go to the task manager page: tasks.hotosm.org

Click, and do so.

(Please feel free to of the task manager if you’d like.  It only takes a minute.)

Once logged in to the task manager, you can click on a task to go to it’s individual project page.

For today’s work, please click on the Typhoon Haiyan - Inland Negros Occidental project.

On the project’s page, please read the Description section for the task area.

Click on the next tab over, called **Workflow**.  Read what it says.

`It is **very important** to pay attention to these sections so that you understand what you are being tasked with. Some projects will have much longer Descriptions and Workflows. In your editing work, please do not take on tasks that you do not understand. If you would like to contribute to something that seems over your head, send an email, ask questions, and get the right info before you edit.`

Once you have read the info under the Description and Workflow tabs, click on the Task tab.

Manually select a tile in the map viewer on the right hand side of the page, or click the  button to be assigned a task.

Click on the  editor option.  This will automatically load the task in your JOSM desktop editor.

4. Tracing Features

The extent of your task tile will automatically load in the JOSM editor that you have open, but the satellite imagery does not.  In order to get your satellite reference imagery:

Go to the Imagery menu at the top of the JOSM editor and choose Bing Sat.

Satellite imagery will load underneath the editable OSM feature records.  This is your reference imagery.

Right click with your mouse to enable yourself to pan around the image.  Choose an area to zoom in.  Use the wheel on your mouse or the zoom bar in the top left corner to zoom in to a spot.

Visually inspect the image.  Try to identify previously unmarked roads and buildings.

When you find an item that needs to be traced, click the **Draw** button.  It is the second icon down in the icon stack on the left side of the JOSM editor.


Trace the item(s).  If you are adding to an existing road or feature, feel free to start at an existing node and continue drawing from there.  If you need to delete a section of an item or an whole item, go back to the icon stack on the left side of the JOSM editor.  Click the selector tool.  It is just above the draw tool. 

Use this tool to individually select features or pieces of a feature.  You may also click and drag to select multiple features or feature parts.  In the Windows environment you can hit your delete button to get rid of features and in Mac OS X you hold fn + delete.  You may also go to your Edit menu and click .

Next we will tag the item.  If you do not tag items as you draw them, you will receive a Warning message when you go to upload your work.  Please take the time to tag the features that you draw.

To add a tag to an item (such as: Building), direct your attention to the right side of the screen.  You should see a Tags/Memberships window docked there. Hover your mouse over that window.  An Add option will appear at the bottom.  Click it.

A dialog box will appear with two fields.  The first will ask you to select a key, and the second to select a value. Click on the drop down menus for each of these fields and inspect your options.

It is important to tag the items you draw in accordance with the instructions given in the Workflow or Task Description tabs on the Task Manager website.  If there are no instructions given, use your best judgement to add a meaningful tag.  Stick with the simple descriptors, i.e. Building, Road for the key field.  Choosing Yes for the value field will suffice if you do not have reasonable information to enable you to give a more descriptive value to an item.
*note: you can quickly tag things by typing ALT-A (Windows) or CMND-A (Mac), which will bring up the tagging menu again with the prior settings already filled in, so you can trace an object, tag it, and continue quickly.



After tracing and tagging a few items, upload them by clicking the  button.  Feel free to do an entire task area before uploading.  However, if you’d like to save your work, the file will be saved to your computer.  If you’d rather remain in the cloud, do not worry about saving, and just upload your work every so often.

Do the following:
    Trace
    Tag
    Upload
    Repeat

You’re doing your part to help the relief effort!

5) When you are finished with a task
Go back to the task manager website.

Feel free to fill in any notes you may have in the comments section.

Click 

Important: If you want to exit a task without completing it there is a sentence underneath the “Mark task as done” box that says   Click on the link to exit the task and free it up for someone else to work on.

6) If you think you are experienced enough to Validate (otherwise skip to 7)

If you are an experienced GIS analyst or OSM mapper, you may be qualified to Validate tiles that are marked as Done.  If this the case, please refer to the take a task page.  Underneath the prompt to Take a Task, there is a small link that will take you to the Validation stage.  You are the only judge who can determine whether you are ready to Validate or not, so please take this seriously.  When you “Validate” a tile, you are saying that the tile has been adequately and accurately mapped.  If you are prepared to take this on, please click on the validate link.

This will take you to a page very similar to the “Take a task” page.  The difference is that you will have the option to  a task, rather than “Mark task as done”.  Your job is to go over the work that has been done by others.  Do so with a diligent eye, and make note of or fix any issues you may find.  Ex- Make sure features are tagged appropriately and roads and buildings have not been missed.  If there are many issues with the task, you can invalidate it and send it back to the tasking queue.  If you’d like to exit a task without giving it a Valid or Invalid vote, you may, just as explained above.

7) A few notes if you would like to continue volunteering

It is good to keep in mind that each task is unique.  Some tasks will use Bing or Mapbox satellite imagery as a reference image. Others will have you download a specific piece of imagery that may have been donated by a hi-res imagery company such as DigitalGlobe.  As long as you are using the portable JOSM editor (the one we have walked you through in these instructions) the imagery will stream straight to the JOSM editor.  You should not have to download it and open it up on your own.  Everything else should work the same as we have described above.  However, if it does not, please don’t hesitate to contact me.  I will do my best to help.  My contact is at the bottom of this document.

The other comment I will make, is that it is imperative that you read the Description and Workflow tabs before working on a specific project.  While volunteering is great, you will squander your own efforts, as well as those of others, if you do not take the time to do the job correctly.  Please take the time to be well informed about the job you are taking on.

Other than that, thank you so much for your time and energy!

Now spread the love.
