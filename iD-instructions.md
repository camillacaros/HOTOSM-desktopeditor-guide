## Welcome!

This set of instructions will help you get set up to be part of the **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap** effort. Please read all of the information below to get started, and feel free to open an issue or ping me with any questions you may have.

### OSM & HOT

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)** is a map of the world that anyone can contribute to. It is often called the wikipedia of maps because it is free to access, contribute to, and download data from. The OSM database is what your volunteer work will contribute to.

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT)** is made up of volunteers from all over the globe who are helping to map previously unmapped areas. More specifically, HOT is geared towards mapping places where humanitarian crises are occurring. The purpose of mapping these areas is to help folks involved in releif efforts better navigate their surroundings, locate people who may be in need, assess damage, and so forth. You can read more about this on the [HOT wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team).

### How to map
Mapping is done by tracing high-resolution satellite imagery. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a volunteer. All you need is an [OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) and little bit of time to give.If you are totally new to tracing, please refer to the [OSM Using Imagery Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_Imagery) page for an introduction. This will give you an introduction to what you will be doing, and will caution you about a few things.

#### HOTOSM Tasking Manager

After you've signed up for an OSM account, head over to the [HOTOSM tasking manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) where you'll pick a tracing task to work on. Use your OSM username and password to login on this page (upper right hand corner). Once logged in to the task manager, click on a task to go to it’s individual project page.

On the project’s page, **read the `Instructions` section for the task area**.

It is **very important** to pay attention to this sections so that you understand what you are being tasked with. Some projects will have much longer Descriptions and Workflows. In your editing work, do not take on tasks that you do not understand. If you would like to contribute to something that seems over your head, send an email, ask questions, and get the right info before you edit.

Once you have read the instructions, click on the next tab over that says `Contribute`. Either click the green 'start mapping' button to be assigned a mapping task, or manually select a tile in the map viewer on the right hand side of the page. Next, the left side of the page will show you a drop down menu or editing options. Click on the default `iD editor` option to start mapping in your web browser window. This will open a new tab in your browser, where you will be able to make changes to the map based on the satellite imagery layer provided. 

#### Working on a task
Once you have the iD editor open, satellite imagery will load underneath the editable OSM feature records. This is your reference imagery.

Visually inspect the image. Try to identify previously unmarked roads and buildings. Pan around and zoom in and out to find buildings, roads, and other features that need to be traced.

When you find an item that needs to be traced, click on the `Point`, `Line` or `Area` tool at the top of the page to pick a tool to draw with. Use this tool to trace the item(s) you've identified. If you are adding to an existing road or feature, feel free to start at an existing node and continue drawing from there.  If you need to delete a section of an item or an whole item.

After you've traced an item, you'll want to use the dashboard on the left side of the page to tag the item as a "road", "building", or otherwise. It is important to tag the items you draw in accordance with the instructions given on the tasking page.  If specific instructions are not given with regards to taggin, use your best judgement to add a meaningful tag.  Stick with the simple descriptors, i.e. Building, Road for the key field.  Choosing Yes for the value field will suffice if you do not have reasonable information to enable you to give a more descriptive value to an item.

Do as much tracing as you can, and be sure to save your work before you exit. Keep in mind that you don't have to finish an entire task to save and exit. Do what you can, and thank you for your contribution!
