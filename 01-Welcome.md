## Welcome!

This set of instructions will help you get set up to be part of the **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap** effort. Please read all of the information below to get started, and feel free to open an issue or ping me with any questions you may have.

### OSM & HOT

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)** is a map of the world that anyone can contribute to. It is often called the wikipedia of maps because it is free to access, contribute to, and download data from. The OSM database is what your volunteer work will contribute to.

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT)** is made up of volunteers from all over the globe who are helping to map previously unmapped areas. More specifically, HOT is geared towards mapping places where humanitarian crises are occurring. The purpose of mapping these areas is to help folks involved in releif efforts better navigate their surroundings, locate people who may be in need, assess damage, and so forth. You can read more about this on the [HOT wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team).

### How to map
Mapping is done by tracing high-resolution satellite imagery. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a volunteer. All you need is an [OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) and little bit of time to give.If you are totally new to tracing, please refer to the [OSM Using Imagery Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_Imagery) page for an introduction. This will give you an introduction to what you will be doing, and will caution you about a few things.

#### HOTOSM Tasking Manager

After you've signed up for an OSM account, head over to the [HOTOSM tasking manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) where you'll pick a tracing task to work on. Use your OSM username and password to login on this page (upper right hand corner). Once logged in to the task manager, click on a task to go to it’s individual project page.

On the project’s page, **read the `Instructions` section for the task area**.

It is **very important** to pay attention to this sections so that you understand what you are being tasked with. Some projects will have much longer Descriptions and Workflows. In your editing work, do not take on tasks that you do not understand. If you would like to contribute to something that seems over your head, send an email, ask questions, and get the right info before you edit.

Once you have read the instructions, click on the next tab over that says `Contribute`. Either click the green 'start mapping' button to be assigned a mapping task, or manually select a tile in the map viewer on the right hand side of the page. Next, the left side of the page will show you a drop down menu or editing options. Click on the default `iD editor` option to start mapping in your web browser window. This will open a new tab in your browser,

Now spread the love.
