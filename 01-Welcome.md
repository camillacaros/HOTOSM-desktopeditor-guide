## Welcome!

This set of instructions will help you get set up to be part of the **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap** effort. Please read all of the information below to get started, and feel free to open an issue or ping me with any questions you may have.

### OSM & HOT

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)** is a map of the world that anyone can contribute to. It is often called the wikipedia of maps because it is free to access, contribute to, and download data from. The OSM database is what your volunteer work will contribute to.

The **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT)** is made up of volunteers from all over the globe who are helping to map previously unmapped areas. More specifically, HOT is geared towards mapping places where humanitarian crises are occurring. The purpose of mapping these areas is to help folks involved in releif efforts better navigate their surroundings, locate people who may be in need, assess damage, and so forth. You can read more about this on the [HOT wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Humanitarian_OSM_Team).

### How to map
Mapping is done by tracing high-resolution satellite imagery. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a volunteer. All you need is an [OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) and little bit of time to give.If you are totally new to tracing, please refer to the [OSM Using Imagery Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_Imagery) page for an introduction. This will give you an introduction to what you will be doing, and will caution you about a few things.

#### HOTOSM Tasking Manager

After you've signed up for an OSM account, head over to the [HOTOSM tasking manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) where you'll pick a tracing task to work on. Use your OSM username and password to login on this page (upper right hand corner). Once logged in to the task manager, click on a task to go to it’s individual project page.

On the project’s page, **read the `Instructions` section for the task area**.

It is **very important** to pay attention to this sections so that you understand what you are being tasked with. Some projects will have much longer Descriptions and Workflows. In your editing work, do not take on tasks that you do not understand. If you would like to contribute to something that seems over your head, send an email, ask questions, and get the right info before you edit.

Once you have read the instructions, click on the next tab over that says `Contribute`direct your attention to the map on the right-hand side of the page and click on an empty square. Manually select a tile in the map viewer on the right hand side of the page, or click the  button to be assigned a task.


#### Picking a HOT Task

It is good to keep in mind that each task is unique.  Some tasks will use Bing or Mapbox satellite imagery as a reference image. Others will have you download a specific piece of imagery that may have been donated by a hi-res imagery company such as DigitalGlobe.  As long as you are using the portable JOSM editor (the one we have walked you through in these instructions) the imagery will stream straight to the JOSM editor.  You should not have to download it and open it up on your own.  Everything else should work the same as we have described above.  However, if it does not, please don’t hesitate to contact me.  I will do my best to help.  My contact is at the bottom of this document.

The other comment I will make, is that it is imperative that you read the Description and Workflow tabs before working on a specific project.  While volunteering is great, you will squander your own efforts, as well as those of others, if you do not take the time to do the job correctly.  Please take the time to be well informed about the job you are taking on.

Other than that, thank you so much for your time and energy!

Now spread the love.
