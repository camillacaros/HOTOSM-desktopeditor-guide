## Welcome!

This set of instructions will help you get set up to be part of the **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap** effort. Please read all of the information below to get started, and feel free to open an issue or ping me with any questions you may have.

### What is HOT

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT) is made up of volunteers from all over the globe who are helping to map previously unmapped areas. This is done by tracing high-resolution satellite imagery. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a volunteer. All you need is an [OpenStreetMap account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) and little bit of time to give.

#### Tracing imagery

If you are totally new to tracing, please refer to the [OSM Using Imagery Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_Imagery) page for an introduction. This will give you an introduction to what you will be doing, and will caution you about a few things.

#### HOTOSM Tasking Manager

After you've signed up for an OSM account, head over to the [HOTOSM tasking manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) where you'll pick a tracing task to work on. Use your OSM username and password to login on this page (upper right hand corner).

Once logged in to the task manager, you can click on a task to go to it’s individual project page.

On the project’s page, **please read the Description section for the task area**.

Click on the next tab over, called **Workflow**.  Read what it says.

It is **very important** to pay attention to these sections so that you understand what you are being tasked with. Some projects will have much longer Descriptions and Workflows. In your editing work, please do not take on tasks that you do not understand. If you would like to contribute to something that seems over your head, send an email, ask questions, and get the right info before you edit.

Once you have read the info under the Description and Workflow tabs, click on the **Task** tab.

Manually select a tile in the map viewer on the right hand side of the page, or click the  button to be assigned a task.

Click on the  editor option.  This will automatically load the task in your JOSM desktop editor.


#### Picking a HOT Task

It is good to keep in mind that each task is unique.  Some tasks will use Bing or Mapbox satellite imagery as a reference image. Others will have you download a specific piece of imagery that may have been donated by a hi-res imagery company such as DigitalGlobe.  As long as you are using the portable JOSM editor (the one we have walked you through in these instructions) the imagery will stream straight to the JOSM editor.  You should not have to download it and open it up on your own.  Everything else should work the same as we have described above.  However, if it does not, please don’t hesitate to contact me.  I will do my best to help.  My contact is at the bottom of this document.

The other comment I will make, is that it is imperative that you read the Description and Workflow tabs before working on a specific project.  While volunteering is great, you will squander your own efforts, as well as those of others, if you do not take the time to do the job correctly.  Please take the time to be well informed about the job you are taking on.

Other than that, thank you so much for your time and energy!

Now spread the love.
