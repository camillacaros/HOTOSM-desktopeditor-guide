## Welcome!

This set of instructions will help you get set up to be part of the **Humanitarian OpenStreetMap** effort. Please read all of the information below to get started, and feel free to open an issue or ping me with any questions you may have.

### What is HOT

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team (HOT) is made up of volunteers from all over the globe who are helping to map previously unmapped areas. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a volunteer. All you need is an OpenStreetMap account (free!) and little bit of time to give. If you do not have an OpenStreetMap account, please see the OSM_signup guide to get started.

#### Tracing imagery

If you are new to digitizing (tracing landscape features with satellite imagery), please refer to the [OSM Using Imagery Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Using_Imagery) page for an introduction to mapping with imagery. This will give you an introduction to what you will be doing, and will caution you about a few things. Some items of note:

#### Local knowledge vs. urgent need

You are about to start contributing to a huge volunteer effort that is, in many cases, time sensitive. While local knowledge about the areas you will be mapping would improve accuracy, your efforts to help locate what appear to be buildings, roads, and other infrastructure are useful contributions to these areas that are previously unmapped.

#### Validation

All of the work you are doing will go to the Validation stage, where an experienced GIS analyst or OSM user will double check your work and give it a thumbs up or thumbs down.  If a thumbs down is given, the Task simply gets filtered back to the Task management system for further edits.
